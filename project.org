* Testing
  - Importing
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (load "/home/ignacio/Desktop/orgpx/orgpx.el")

      (setq orgpx-imported-file "/home/ignacio/Desktop/orgpx/example2.gpx")
      (setq orgpx-default-locations-file "/home/ignacio/Desktop/orgpx/locations.org")

      (orgpx-import)
    #+end_src


* TODOs
** TODO [#C] Decide definitive format for location entries
   - Entries to be considered must have
     - ? tag to indicate they are a location
     - latitude and longitud properties
     - name property (otherwise the name is the heading)
     - type(s) property (otherwise the types are the tags)
       - and if there is more than one, locations will be duplicated in
         the gpx file, since OsmAnd only supports one
     - The description is the entry's content
     - other fields property for all other fields that I don't care
       but someone else might
       - date
       - address
       - description
       - icon
       - background
       - color
     - can gpx support (by ignoring) custom attributes that only make sense in org?
** TODO [#D] Handle more waypoint attributes
** Importing
*** TODO [#C] Truly synchronize
    - Don't add what it's already there
    - Keep track of what has been explicitely removed on the other
      side and remove it here too
*** TODO [#C] Refile places as they are imported from gpx file
    - Have a function to refile entries interactively
    - It can be invoked while importing, or later from default refile target
*** TODO [#D] Support multiple tags/types for the same location
    - In OsmAnd they must be necessarily duplicated
    - In files to be imported too
    - In org-mode they need to be merged
    - In exported files, probably they need to be duplicated too in
      order for it to be imported again by OsmAnd
*** TODO [#D] Function to download gpx file from Telegram and leave it in a convenient place
    - Just have a chat named my-locations and it will always be the last message
    - In the future, it could be a bot and implement extra
      functionality there
*** TODO [#D] Infer refile file/path in some scenarios
    - (e.g., same category as locations that are all in the same file)
      and suggest it.
