# orgpx
conversion between gpx files and org-mode entries

This project is inspired by the need to organize and interact with
saved places in maps applications like OsmAnd in a better way. It
provides mechanisms to organize your favourite places as org-mode
entries and synchronizing them with a gpx file, which can in turn be
synchronized (manually, or with some other project) with some maps
applications, like OsmAnd.
